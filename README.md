# API_Challenge

Part 1: WeatherPy
In this section, i created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities of varying distance from the equator. To do so, i used a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and my problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.


The first requirement is to create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Temperature (F) vs. Latitude

Humidity (%) vs. Latitude

Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude

Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

After each plot, i have a sentence or two explaining what the code is analyzing.


The second requirement is to compute the linear regression for each relationship. This time, separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):

Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude

Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude

Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude

Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude


After each pair of plots, i tried to explain what the linear regression is modeling.

Save a CSV of all retrieved data and a PNG image for each scatter plot.
